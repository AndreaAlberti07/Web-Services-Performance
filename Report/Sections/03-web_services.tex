The increasing frequency of user interactions with websites has brought to light the criticality of website performance 
in delivering a satisfactory user experience. Among the key performance factors, page load time holds significant importance. 
To optimize this aspect, an option is to focus on managing the number of parallel connections exploitable between client and server,
and implementing effective caching policies. The ultimate objective is to minimize page load time (PLT), thus 
fostering user engagement and ensuring an enhanced user experience.
